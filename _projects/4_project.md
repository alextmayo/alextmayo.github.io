During quarantine, my friend group had missed going out to the local arcade to play games like DDR.  So a couple of us decided to build a DDR dance pad to use as a home arcade machine. 

Our goal was to create controller peripheral that took analog inputs to be used to play a video game on a PC

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/DDR_iteration2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/DDR_iteration3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    We went through several iterations of the dance pad with each trial and error.

What began as something fun to kill time during quarantine grew into a large scale project that taught us the importance of scope, budget, teamwork, and logistics.

Key components to the success of our project was the collective knowledge of the group, use of 3D printing for the more complex parts of the DDR pad, and the use of precision woodworking tools accessible from my fathers workshop
